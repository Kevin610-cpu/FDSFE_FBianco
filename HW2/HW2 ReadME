what is this homework about? Collecting and analyzing data from a youtube video. This is not the only aspect as we also plotted the information figuring out things like the median, max, min, etc.
who did you work with? I did not work with anyone. I tried to, but no response. I did have trouble with the homework sorry for the late submission.
did you lead any of the work in your group? what where your specific contributions (if you were not ready to lead any aspect that is perfectly ok, just state so! but you and your group mates should have consistent statements)
I did the whole thing by myself so everything was my contribution.
